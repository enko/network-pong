* network-pong
** Description

The aim of this project is to have a game of pong and controll it with
your handheld and display it on a wall with a projector.

** Todo

  - somehow the disconnect event is sometimes triggered when it should not?
  - tap event is maybe somewhat slow? I think I need to better understand the game
  - Add i18n (use https://github.com/jamuhl/i18next)


** Install

  - You need to have installed node and npm.
  - Run 'npm install'
  - Run 'node app.js'
  - Steer your projector to http://foobar:3000/game and everything
    else should be self-explanatory

** Thanks
